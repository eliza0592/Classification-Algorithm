# Classification-Algorithm
A study on the prediction of early-stage diabetes risk using classification machine learning algorithms.
Machine learning classification approaches of Decision Trees, KNN, Logical Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks are used to predict diabetes in a patient. 
On a variety of metrics, the experimental performance of each algorithm was compared and revealed high precision.
